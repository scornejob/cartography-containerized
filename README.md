 The image offered by Cartography didn't work for me because architecture... So I'm building my own:

 `‚ùØ docker build -t cartography:seba .`

 which is later referenced in the compose file. You can tagg and fix as you wish

 Cartography requires AWS credentials in `~/.aws`, so you should write your credentials into the
 `aws_config` file, and docker compose will mount it in the right place.

 From there, it cartography will run and populate neo4j. You can check neo4j on `http://localhost:7474`, 

 username: `admin`
 password: `password`
